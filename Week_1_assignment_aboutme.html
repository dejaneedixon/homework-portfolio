  <h3>An attempt to teach an old dog new tricks</h3>
  I've recently developed a new love for the interwebs, being that I've been working as a site producer for almost 3 years. I started out at my company way back in 2014 as a temporary customer service agent with every intent on being hired on permanent and moving my way right on up. Year one, I went from temp to permanent, regular customer service agent to team lead, team lead to team lead/production assistent on our creative team, to the grand finale of site producer.
