  <p><img src="../homework-portfolio/profilepic.jpg" alt="Dejanee Dixon">
    I've recently developed a new curious love for the interwebs, being that I've been working as a site producer for almost 3 years. I started out at my company way back in 2014 as a temporary customer service agent with every intent on being hired on permanent and moving my way right on up. Through the last four years, I have gone from a temp to permanent employee, regular customer service agent to a team lead, a team lead to supervisor/production assistant, to the grand finale of site producer. Within each department I was determined to be the best so my growth would continue to blossom. So here I am, ready to tackle a new skill that will assist in my continued growth within the company.</p>
